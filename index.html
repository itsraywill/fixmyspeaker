<h2><strong>Apple's official advice </strong></h2>
<p>Before sharing the guidelines for cleaning iPhone speaker holes, let me share Apple's official advice on cleaning iPhone speakers for a long life and crystal clear sound without dust and damage.</p>
<p>Since Apple is the company that makes the iPhones, we believed we'd check out their official guide on cleaning them. <strong>Apple States:</strong>  "If necessary, use a small, soft-bristled brush to clean the speaker or receiver opening," advises Apple. Make that the brush is dry and clean."</p>
<p>Here is Apple's official advice for cleaning iPhone Speakers from dust particles and low-quality sound.</p>
<h2><strong>Make sure your iPhone Speakers are working</strong></h2>
<p>Before cleaning your speakers and removing dust, ensure they are working fine. Here are the quick steps to check your speakers quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the Settings app on your iPhone, then select <strong>"Sounds"</strong> or <strong>"Sounds & Haptics"</strong> based on your iOS version.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Locate and move the <strong>"Ringer and Alerts"</strong> slider a few times back and forth. This should generate a ringtone sound with different loudness settings.</p>
<p>Your speaker may require service if it is silent or the <strong>"Ringer and Alerts"</strong> slider shows a dimmed speaker button.</p>
<h2><strong>Things to Avoid in Cleaning Speakers</strong></h2>
<p>Before cleaning iPhone speaker holes, ensure you are cleaning them safely and do not damage the speakers because your rough cleaning techniques and tools used in this cleaning process cause internal damage. Here are the everyday things you need to avoid for Speakers.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Don't use any sharp objects, like toothpicks and tweezers.</li>
  <li>Don't use rubbing alcohol or other liquid for the iPhone.</li>
  <li>Don't use canned, compressed air.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the basic things you need to avoid before you start cleaning your iPhone Speakers because they can cause internal damage to the speaker of your iPhone.</p>
<h2><strong>How to Clean iPhone Speaker Holes</strong></h2>
<p>Finally, here I am sharing some basic methods for cleaning iPhone speaker holes and removing internal dust from the speakers to clear HD sound without experiencing low sound or muffled.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The most important thing is not to use liquid or alcohol to clean speakers on your smartphones. It will cause internal damage and you cannot fix them by yourself. Try to avoid them in any case.</p>
<h3><strong>Method 1: Soft Brush</strong></h3>
<p>Apple suggests using a brush with gentle bristles to clean the speakers. </p>
<ol>
  <li>Take off all iPhone covers and screen protectors. </li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<ol>
  <li>To see what you're dealing with, shine a flashlight into the speaker notches.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<ol>
  <li>To prevent damage, make sure the brush you're about to use has soft bristles, is clean, and is dry. For this, cosmetics or paintbrushes work well.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<ol>
  <li>Angle the brush so that dust is swept out rather than pushed in, starting with the receiving speaker and moving softly from side to side. </li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<ol>
  <li>Repeat this several times, wiping the brush clean between strokes to remove any extra dust. </li>
</ol>
<p>By following the above, steps for cleaning speakers you can easily clean your iPhone speakers at your home without facing any problems or calling any service center.</p>
<h3><strong>Method 2: Painter's tape</strong></h3>
<p>Masking or painter's tape is another widely used technique. This type of tape won't leave any residue on your phone and isn't as strong as other types. </p>
<ol>
  <li>To make it easier to reach the speakers, take off the case and screen protector.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<ol>
  <li>Use your flashlight to get a clearer picture of the junk. </li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<ol>
  <li>With the adhesive side facing down, encircle the tip of your finger with a small piece of painter's tape. You can buy it at any online store like Amazon.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<ol>
  <li>To collect dust, place your finger over the speaker and roll it back and forth. Just enough pressure is required for the tape to enter the speaker; it doesn't need to be applied heavily. </li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p>After following my two above methods, you can remove dust from the speakers and easily clean your iPhone Speaker Holes without any problem.</p>
